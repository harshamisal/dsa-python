Problem: Two Sum
Platform: LeetCode
Difficulty: Easy
Topic: Arrays + Hashing

Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target,
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Approach:
- Use a hash map to store seen numbers
- For each number, check if (target - num) exists

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
